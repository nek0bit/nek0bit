# Hello, I'm Nekobit ðŸ‘‹

I also host at [https://git.nekobit.net/](https://git.nekobit.net/), and I mostly "mirror" my projects over here.

Of course, I still host my stuff here as well so you may send any PR's or Issues, but you're welcome to send them over [email](mailto:hhhyland.belcherrr4@gmail.com).
