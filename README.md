Well, I still push here and use this account. I might contribute to a project thats on github every
once and then as well. But for my own code I use my own service, it's mostly convient for me and it's
100% optional for you to go there, it uses gitea software which is similar to github.

You might be here because you want to submit an issue or PR... well good news, I do check my github
and handle PRs and issues, and sometimes you are encouraged to use it here! (because most people
have an account here, and I don't allow accounts on my git service)

But for convience and publicity, I push here **(like a mirror)** so you can browse my repos here.
I **don't** put wikis and release info here, but as I said, I do respond to issues, pr, code
comments, etc. Thank you
